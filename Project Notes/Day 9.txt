-->Deployment AWS Beanstalk elastic
-->We need to setup 2 important conifiguration whenever we are working with elastic beanstalk
-->Elastic beanstalk is kind of an instance wherein you can probably deploy your entire application.
-->Create a ebextensions outside of src folder and inside this folder,create python.config file.--this file is to tell elastic beanstalk as to what is the entry point to your application.
-->Create application.py file as we dont have it currently for above code.So copy app.py content and create application.py file only for deployment purpose.
-->Remove debug=True in app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True, use_reloader=False) because for deployment we must remove it.   
-->Commit and push all of this to your github
-->Now we need to deploy the project onto AWS.
-->Open AWS console account,search for elastic beanstalk-->click on applications->create application->Student performance(name)->select sample application and create application
->now search for codepipeline in search bar->create new pipeline name studentperformance->select source as githin version 1 and fill in other details->deploy provider is elastic beanstalk(this is very important step)->click on next->entire pipeline setting will be displayed-->make sure to delete app.py from github as it might throw error while deploying in elastic beanstalk


-->CodePipeline is used to push the code from github repository to AWS elastic beanstalk automatically.This is also known as continuous delivery pipeline.
Steps for deployment:
1) We will first create an instance for elastic beanstalk which can be a linux machine and we will also create an environment and do the setup.
2)Create a codepipeline through which we will integrate with gituh repository and contune the deployment process.
