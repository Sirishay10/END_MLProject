Data Ingestion:
-->Write the code for data ingestion.py
-->DataIngestionConfig--if we need to give any input through data ingestion we do that through this class
-->@dataclass->used to define your class variable unlike having to create init()
-->Define the train,test and raw files path
-->If you have functions in a class and not just variables then it is suggested to create the init constructor in the class.
-->initiate_data_ingestion is written so if you need any data from database this will fetch the data.
